**Day1 of MachineLearningDeepLearning**
- On my Journey of Machine Learning and Deep Learning, I have been reading about History of Deep Learning, Image Fundamentals, Pixels, Scaling and Aspect Ratios, Image Classification, Semantic Gap, Feature Extraction, Viewpoint Variation, Scale Variation, Deformation, Occlusions, Illumination, Background Clutter, Intra-class Variation, Supervised and Unsupervised Learning and few more topics related to the same. I have presented the notes about Image Classification, Semantic Gap, Feature Extraction, Supervised and Unsupervised Learning here in the snapshot. I hope you will also spend some time learning the topics from the Book mentioned below. Excited about the days ahead !!

**Day3 of MachineLearningDeepLearning**
- **K-Nearest Neighbor**: K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier doesnâ€™t actually learn anything, but it directly relies on the distance between feature vectors. On my Journey of Machine Learning and Deep Learning, I have been reading the book "Deep Learning for Computer Vision with Python". Here, I have been reading about Image Classification, K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier, Partitioning Dataset, Preprocessing Images, Model Evaluation and Classification Report, Label Encoder, Hyperparameters and few more topics related to the same from here. I have presented the implementation of K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier and Model Evaluation here in the snapshot. I hope you will gain some insights and work on the same. I hope you will also spend some time learning the topics from the Book mentioned below. Excited about the days ahead !!
